/**
 * \file ISputnikCommand.h
 *
 *  Abstracts the definition and handling of a single command for the Sputnik Inverter.
 *
 *  The past implementation had a function for every command the inverter
 *  understands, consisting some thousand lines of basically identical code.
 *  To add one command the file had to be edited on several page.
 *
 *  To fight this and increase maintainability along reducing code complexity this
 *  "strategy" pattern has been implemented.
 *  Using this pattern the inverter has (except for the creation of the
 *  CSputnikCommand) no special knowledge about the commands it will issue.
 *
 *  The objects encapsulates all information needed to handle the command
 *   - information about the "command token" (token itself, length, max answer
 *     length)
 *   - information about the data we receive (type, capability name)
 *   - handles the registration of this data with the inverter.
 *
 *  This interface is the base class for the commands. There are two basic
 *  variants of derived classes:
 *  - Most of the commands use simple datatype (integer, float, boolean ...)
 *  - Some commands needs special implementation (for example the Software-
 *    Version needs to assemble the information from two inverter queries)
 *
 *  For the first category, the templated "CSputnikCommand<type>" can be used,
 *  for the others derived classes like the "CSputnikCommandSoftwareVersion"
 *  come into the game.
