/* Defines and handles a single commmand the Sputnik Inverter.
 *
 * CSputnikCommand (CSC) will in the long term replace the handling code in
 * CSputnikInverter for an object orientated approach.
 *
 * The object will store all knowledge about an individual command, allows the
 * parsing and eventually will also take over the Capabilities handling.
 *
 * It will also allow an strategy to wisely let the command itself decide when it
 * should be issued and how often, and to probe if an actual command is indeed supported
 * by the inverter.
 *
 * Milestones to implement functionality:
 *  1- CSC will store information about
 *      - (implemented) command token, scaling information, expected telegram length,
 *      - (implemented for basic types) do the parsing and return the parsed result.
 *
 *  2- CSC will keep track if a command is supported by the Inverter and cease issuing command if not.
 *  3- (Specialisations of CSCs might handle for some commands more often than others.)
 *  4- CSC will take the Capabilities handling: creating the Capabilities, updating the values, notfiing subscribers
 *
 *  Strategy:
 *  - CSCs are kept in a list attached to the Inverters Object
 *  - The CSCS are instanciated on construction time of the Inverter's object with all the information they need to operate.
 *  5- CSC will be registered by the Inverter at Instanciation time by key parameters-
 *
