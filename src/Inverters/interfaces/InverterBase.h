 *
 * This is the interface for inverters.
 *
 * \page IInverterBase IInverterBase: Interface for Inverters
 * \ingroup Concepts
 *
 * IIinverterBase is the interface which should be used for all inverters.
 * It is also the base class for all DataFilters, (IDataFilter), as they
 * also need most of the infracstructure for their duties.
 *
 * It is ought to be derived, and the concrete implemenation implements the
 * data aquisition.
 *
 * To help avoiding doublicated code, the base class have contains already some
 * code for the following funcions:
 *	- <b>\ref IIBConnection "Comms"</b>
 *		- Generate the concrete connection object (IConnect
 *		  derived) The type of connection is extracted automatically
 *		  from the configuration. On Datafilters, a default "Dummy"
 *		  Connection will be created, if the specific configuratoin
 *		  entries are missing.
 *	- <b>\ref IIBCapabilites "Capabilites"</b>
 *		- Generating the required CCapabilites (see
 *		  #Inverters/Capabilites.h)
 *		- Infrastructure around Capabilites: Adding, Iterator, Finding
 *	          an concrete Capability...
 *	 - <b> \ref IIBWorkScheduler "Target for a WorkScheduler" </b>
 *	 	- Inverters should use solarpowerlog's Work Scheduler for
 *	 	  execution planning. To be able to receive ICommands they are
 *	 	  derived from ICommandTarget.
 *	        - By using the default Scheduler (see #Registry), concurrency
 *	          is avoided, so there is no need for locking methods for common
 *	          accessed datas.
 *
 * \section IIBConnection Connection: Connecting to the word.
 *
 * As stated before, the base class creates the communication object.
 * To determine which connectiion type is to be used, it will use the factory
 * IConnectionFactory. This factory looks in the configuration-path -- supplied
 * by the bootstrap code -- for the entry "commtype" and create the associated
 * comms object.
 *
 * BTW: The connection classes will also retrieve their configuration from the
 * config file automatically.
 *
 * The comms object will <b>not</b> automatically connect. This should be done
 * later while running the initializtion commmand (see workqueue below)
 *
 * \image html inverter_comm.png "Connection Services"
 *
 * The image above shows the services currently exists for the comm classes.
 *
 * Currently, the connection classed are mixed synchron and asynchronous. But
 * this will change, the connection class should use asynchronous
 * methods to avoid blocking the main task while waiting for completion.
 *
 * This also implies, that the inverters have to implement some kind of time-out
 * handling by itself. (Well its on the TODO list: \todo implement some kind of
 * generic timeout handling, like schedule timeout, cancel timeout.)
 *
 * \sa #IInverterBase::connection
 *
 * \section IIBCapabilites How Capabilites transport datas
 *
 * As described \ref CapaConcept "here", Capabilies store abstraced measurement
 * values as well as some meta-datas controlling the Capabilites itself.
 *
 * Simplified, the values are generated at the inverter's object and passed
 * down to Datafilters (or loggers).
 *
 * \image html FilterSequence.png "Capabilitiy passed through two filters (simplified)"
 *
 * The data is passed along the Filters using the Observer Design pattern
 * inheritated by the capability: Upon updating it, the Inverter calls the
 * Notify function and the DataFilter gets notified.
 *
 * As illustrated,
 * Datafilters can also be chained. With this abitrary data
 * manipulations can be achieved: The datafilter can calculate additional data
 * sets (example: Efficiency out of Pin and Pout), or do some other arithmetics
 * on them (mean value...)
 *
 * Datafilters can also be parallel to e.g enable parallel serving of data to
 * different logging systems: One would log to disk, the other servin a web
 * page.
 *
 * By the way, the Inverter manages a list of capablities in the map
 * (IInverterBase::CapabilityMap). (The map is organized in pairs of
 * <string,CCapability*> containing the description of the Capability and a
 * pointer to the Capability.) However, there is an API to access the Capability
 * in IInverteBase and an enhanced one in IDataFilter.
 *
 * ( \todo More details are planned to appear on the IDataFilter description.)
 *
 * The image below shows all the classes involved in the dataflow from the
 * Inverter to the DataFilter:
 *
 * \image html dataflow_classes.png "Classes needed to let the data flow"
 *
 * This image shows how a typical update of a Capbility, and how the Data-Filter
 * receives the information.
 *
 * \image html dataflow_sequence.png "Dataflow Sequence Diagram"
 *
 * \subsection IIBCSnip Code-Snippets around Capabilites.
 *
 * <b> Unconditionally Register a new Capability </b>(e.g in the constructor)
 * \code
 * 	c = new CCapability(CAPA_CAPAS_UPDATED, CAPA_CAPAS_UPDATED_TYPE, this);
 *	AddCapability(CAPA_CAPAS_UPDATED, c);
 * * \endcode
 *
 * <b> Update a Capability's Value, create if not existance. Check for type </b>
 *\code
 *
 * CCapability *cap = GetConcreteCapability(CAPA_INVERTER_TEMPERATURE_NAME);
 *
 * if (!cap) {
 *	string s;
 *	IValue *v;
 *	CCapability *c;
 *	s = CAPA_INVERTER_TEMPERATURE_NAME;
 *	v = IValue::Factory(CAPA_INVERTER_TEMPERATURE_TYPE);
 *	((CValue<float>*) v)->Set(f);
 *	c = new CCapability(s, v, this);
 *	AddCapability(s, c);
 *
 *	cap = GetConcreteCapability(CAPA_CAPAS_UPDATED);
 *	cap->Notify();
 * }
 *
 * // Capa already in the list. Check if we need to update it.
 * else if (cap->getValue()->GetType() == CAPA_INVERTER_TEMPERATURE_TYPE) {
 * 	CValue<float> *val = (CValue<float>*) cap->getValue();
 *
 *	if (val -> Get() != f) {
 *		val->Set(f);
 *		cap->Notify();
 *	}
 * } else {
 *	cerr << "BUG: " << CAPA_INVERTER_TEMPERATURE_NAME*
 *	<< " not a float ";
 * }
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * \section IIBWorkScheduler "Work Scheduler"
 *
 * IInverterbase is derived from ICOmmandTarget. This class can reiceive
 * commands from CWorkSchedule objects. One CWorkSchedule object can be received
 * by the #Registry, which is open for all objects to use. (This Scheduler is
 * operated by solarpowerlogs internals, so no extra code is required to have
 * an operating schedule.)
 *
 * For Details, for example, how to use a CWorkSchedule and how to schedule
 * some Work in a specific amount of time, please see the \ref PageCWorkSchedule
 * "WorkScheduler overview" Page.
 *
 * \todo that Workscheduler-Page is not yet written,
