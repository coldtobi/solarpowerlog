 * \page CVSDataLogger [LOGGER] CVSDataLogger: Logging to CSV Files
 *
 * \section DLCSV_Description Overview
 * The CSV Data Logger takes some or all data and writes it to a regular comma-
 * sepearated-file.
 *
 * The data to be logged can be selected by specifying the identifiers or
 * all data.
 *
 * Solarpowerlog honors the RFC 4180. However, some feature, like the "log all"
 * feature causes that for example the number of columns changes during runtime.
 * (However, patches will be accepted to fix this: For example, on a new feature,
 * one could just reparse the file and add the missing datas.
 *
 * If some data is unavailable, it will be logged with an empty value.
 *
 * To increase the use of the logfile, a (ISO 8601)-like timestamp
 * will be inserted as the first column.
 *
 * \section DLCSV_Configuration Configuration
 *
 * As every logger, the CSV Logger is configured using the Loggers Section.
 *
 * <TABLE border=1 summary="CSV Logger Configuration Options" >
 * <tr>
 * 	<td> <b>Option</b> </td>
 * 	<td> <b>Type</b> </td>

 * <tr>
 * 	<td> flush_file_buffer_immediatly </td>
 * 	<td> bool  </td>
 * 	<td> &nbsp;</th>
 *  	<td> false  </td>
 *      <td> if true, do not cache information but immediately write to disk.
 *      If you are "only logging" this might be fine to set to false, if you do
 *      some kind of real-time data processing, make this false, as it might
 *      take some times for the data to enter the disk.
 *      One use of this option disabled is if you log to flash memory or if
 *      you want to avoid spinning up disks.
 *      \note Solarpowerlog only hints the operating system to flush the file
 *       buffers. The OS or hardware (harddisk) still might use some caching.
 *      \note Even if this is setting is false, the operating system will still
 *      take care that the data is written to the disk usually after a few
 *      seconds.)
 *      \note Up to version 0.21 including this setting was default set to true.

 *      <br/>
 *      However, the default set the date in the ISO 8601 format, for example

 *      </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <b>logfile:</b>
 * With lofile the filename to log to will be specified.
 * If "rotate" is enabled, this logger will
 * begin a new logfile at midnight . To avoid overwriting the old logfile it will
 * add the current date to the filename, using by default an ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD.
 * To specify *where* the timestamp should be placed, use "%s".
 * If %s is not given, it will be appended *at the end* of the filename.
 * For example
 * \code
 * 	logfile="Inverter_1_%s.csv"
 * \endcode
 * will create a logfile like "Inverter_1_2009-07-04.csv"
 *
 * To set the format of the timestamp see the option <b>format_timestamp</b>.
 *
 * <b> data2log:</b>
 *
 * To specify which data should be logged, their identifiers have to be listed in a
 * array.
 *
 * The identifiers supported can be retrieved by either the inverter's
 * documentation, in the documentation of the intermediate datafilters.
 *
 * One can also use the DumbDumper logger or run the CVS Logger in the "all" mode
 * to obtain a list.
 *
 * \note The identifiers are case sensitive!
 *
 * Array-Example:
 * \code
 *  data2log = [
 *  	"Current Grid Feeding Power",
 *  	"Energy produced today (kWh)",
 *  	"Energy produced this month (kWh)",
 *      "DC voltage in (V)"
 * ];
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you want to use the "log all" feature, just say "all" or do not specify the data to log
 * (as "all" is the default)
 *
 * \note When selecting "all features" and new features are detected at runtime,
 * the CSV-header will be written again with the new data added to a new column.
 * If you want to avoid having ever-changing tables, please configure
 * all the data you want to see in the log file. Data which is not present all
 * the time will then still gets its placeholder in the output file.
