 *   Interface for all filters, data enhancers and finally all data-sinks
 *   (which do not implement the ObserverSubject pattern)
 *
 *   How it works:
 *   - A filter, when instanciatesd, gets its configuration its own name
 *   - Using that configuration, it connects to the data source (type IInverterBase)
 *     and subscribes at least to the CAPA Notifications of the data source
 *   - the filter is aware, that most likely the capabilites will change over
 *     runtime. It will only serve the
 *   - If a cdownsteram filter queries for something which is not
 *     modified or created, the request is simply forwarded upstream
