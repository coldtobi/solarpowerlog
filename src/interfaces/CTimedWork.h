/** This class bundles a timed activity.

 * The Timedwork are fed into a worker thread, which just waits for the time
 * to come and signal the event back to the CWorkScheduler object.
 *
 * On new requests, the worker thread will only be interrupted if the new event
 * expires earlier than the current one.
 *
 * \note: There was an bug in boost::thread in boost release 1.46 which
 * caused solarpowerlog to freeze after a while. This is why the code is
 * still littered with debug statements, enabled with the define
 * CTIMEDWORK_DEBUG (via CTimedWork.cpp or via C[XX]FLAGS)
