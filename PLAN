ROADMAP 

BRAIN STORMING
--> at least two-fold software:
  a) data acquisition and storage
      aqui:
        -> aqc. using interfaces
        -> more than inverter should be supported
      storage
          -> storage in database, (sql csv, xml, whatever, file....)
	    -> format should be flexible enough to support additional inverters as well as 
	       ones that does not support all data or supply extra ones. (expect no minimal data set!) 
	       --> defining some types of data, describing the property of the data entry 
	         like, "flag", "plot"
	  -> what to do with proposes non-standard features
	  -> maybe secondary storage for more volatile datas like system state, error display....
	  -> 
	 
  b) visualization 
      -> generate graphs 
	  -> up-to-now
	  -> prognosen
      -> display current state of the system
      -> generate graphs (pictures, html, ....) with 
	  -> statistics, 
	  -> logbook (events)
	  
      
  c) reporting
      -> alerting on system problems (using mail, for example)
      -> reporting statistics to mail (mailing)
      (Mailing not considered for embedded pltforms)
  
-->  DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
  a) aquisition and storage : daemon 
  b) visualization: can be web application (php) or stand alone program
  c) should share configuration files
  
CHANGE ME
 a) Change logging to a logging library -- it is currently hardwired to cerr.
