# This example-snippet shows how to use the DB Writer in single mode.
# it only focues on this part, all unrelated options are NOT shown.
# this snipped goes into the db_jobs list.

# The snipped below will setup logging so that a single row will be
# continously updated with the latest value.
# This can be for example used to generated an overview / snapshot of the
# current data when history is not neccessary.
# The example below will log to the database the current power along
# with the timestamp, overwriting the values with every update.

# Note: In single mode, only "$" selektors can be used. "!" type selektors
# work only in cumulative mode.
