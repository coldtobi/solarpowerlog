solarpowerlog (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

   * [CSV Dumper] 
	- can (as confiureable) now have a ISO 8601 timestamp (closing #2).
	  Defaults to ISO 8601, "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" 
	- the files will be now more compact, as we are not writing spaces
	  before and after the seperator
	- optionally, it will write "compacter" file, writing only if any data
	  actually changed. 
	- also, if used as only CSV Logging, I/Os can be reduced by disabling
	  "flusing" after every write. (default is "off", as the previous 
	  behaviour.
	- Preparing for plugins that make use of the CSV: Adding capabilites
	  what is logged and where the file is located. 
	- Removed some checks from unused configuration parameters
	- Rotate was not checked in CheckConfig()
	- Added two capabilites, one telling the filename, the other telling what
	  we are currently logging (preparing for visualization)
	- A little more RFC-something conform -- also in the header
   * [HTMLWRITER]
    - A new data filter. This is the reason why we release 0.20
      This filter can write out HTML pages which show nice visualizations.
    - Added examples for this writer
   * [GENERAL] 
    - Some typos in the Capabilites names fixed. 
    - Added an external library, ctemplate, for HTML Writer. 
    - Modified this library to emit smaller pages.

solarpowerlog (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

   * Communication is now done asynchronous instead of polling.
     This should improve the timing accuracy, as well laying the
     preparing for a"daisy-chain-commmunications-module"
   * Added a simple simulator to enable debugging at night
   * FTBFS fixed when lib4logcxx was unavailable
   * New parameter "--version"
   * CVSDumper: Bugfix for Win32, "Won't open file"
   * Fixing a build error on newer boost libraries
   * Autotools: Fix for Win32: liblog4cxx depends on apr and needs also to 
     link in this library. This was not seen on linux.
   * Autotools: Added missing m4 macros
   * Autotools fix: now autotools will also run under win32 to generate the
     configure script
   * Many other tweaks and code rewrites....

solarpowerlog (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Feature: CVSOutputFilter -- writes data to a CVS file
  * New Feature: Config-File can be specified with command line option. 
  * Many Fixes / Enhancements:
  * autotools: boost detection was broken 
  * avoiding dependency from boost::asio to boost::regex 
  * new depedency on boost::progamm_options, used to parse program options
    (parameters given on commmand line. Checkout solarpowerlog --help
  * applied config.h inclusion to all files.
  * Added some files for which autotools are needed to reconstruct.
    This is, as I had problems recreating them under cygwin.
  * ported to Win32. (Builds at least under XP and cygwin. ) 
    (Closes BT-0000001)
  * CTimedWork: Fixed a bug that only showed on Win32.
  * Add CConfigHelper for easier Config-Handling.
  * Lots of documentation added 
  * Fixes a bug ("debug leftover") in the TCP (ASIO) class.
  * Another bug in the tokenizer -- strangly did not show under eclipse,
    but under "make" made executeables...
