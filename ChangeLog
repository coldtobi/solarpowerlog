solarpowerlog (trunk)

  * autotools: boost detection was broken 
  * avoiding dependency from boost::asio to boost::regex 
  * new depedency on boost::progamm_options, used to parse program options
    (parameters given on commmand line. Checkout solarpowerlog --help
  * applied config.h inclusion to all files.
  * Added some files for which autotools are needed to reconstruct.
    This is, as I had problems recreating them under cygwin.
  * ported to Win32. (Builds at least under XP and cygwin. ) 
    (Closes BT-0000001)
  * CTimedWork: Fixed a bug that only showed on Win32.
  * Add CConfigHelper for easier Config-Handling.
  * Lots of documentation added 
  * Fixes a bug ("debug leftover") in the TCP (ASIO) class.
  * Another bug in the tokenizer -- strangly did not show under eclipse,
    but under "make" made executeables...
