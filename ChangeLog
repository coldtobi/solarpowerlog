solarpowerlog (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

   * Communication is now done asynchronous instead of polling.
     This should improve the timing accuracy, as well laying the
     preparing for a"daisy-chain-commmunications-module"
   * Added a simple simulator to enable debugging at night
   * FTBFS fixed when lib4logcxx was unavailable
   * New parameter "--version"
   * CVSDumper: Bugfix for Win32, "Won't open file"
   * Fixing a build error on newer boost libraries
   * Autotools: Fix for Win32: liblog4cxx depends on apr and needs also to 
     link in this library. This was not seen on linux.
   * Autotools: Added missing m4 macros
   * Autotools fix: now autotools will also run under win32 to generate the
     configure script
   * Many other tweaks and code rewrites....

    (parameters given on commmand line. Checkout solarpowerlog --help

  * Added some files for which autotools are needed to reconstruct.
    This is, as I had problems recreating them under cygwin.

    (Closes BT-0000001)
  * CTimedWork: Fixed a bug that only showed on Win32.
  * Add CConfigHelper for easier Config-Handling.
  * Lots of documentation added
