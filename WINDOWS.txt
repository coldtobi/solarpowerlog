INSTALL
=======

currently, solarpowerlog needs no install. It can be run directly.


However, it needs two libaries:

Libconfig 1.3.2  (cygconfig+8.dll)

Libconfig is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. You can download the (unmodified) 
sources from (which the library was built) from my site at http://frost.de/files/libconfig-1.3.2.tar.gz.
The file is distributed in this file. It just have to be in the same directory as the programm. 

Cygwin cygwin1.dll 

Cygwin is also an Open Source Project, located at http://www.cygwin.com/
Please download the setup.exe from their site and execute it. Installing it with the default options
will install the library.


RUNNING
========

solarpowerlog is a console programm. There is not GUI.
On startup, it will read a "solarpowerlog.conf" to retrieve its settings. 

Configuration details are the same as for the Linux version. So please see README for details.
(Note: Open the file in "wordpad" to get the right line breaks.)


Have Fun!
