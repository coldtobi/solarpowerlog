WINDOWS USERS README

INSTALL
=======

currently, solarpowerlog needs no install. It can be run directly.

However, it needs two libaries:

Libconfig 1.3.2  (cygconfig+8.dll)

Libconfig is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. You can download the (unmodified) 
sources from (which the library was built) from my site at http://frost.de/files/libconfig-1.3.2.tar.gz.
The library itself is distributed in the zip file of solarpowerlog. It just have to be in the same directory as the program. 

Cygwin cygwin1.dll, cygexpat-0.dll 

Cygwin is also an Open Source Project, located at http://www.cygwin.com/
Please download the setup.exe from their site and execute it. Installing it with the default options
will install the library.
If solarpowerlog claims for a missing cygexpat-0.dll you need the package libexpat0. 

All other libraries used in the program should be only used at compile time


RUNNING
========

solarpowerlog is a console program. There is not GUI.
On startup, it will read a "solarpowerlog.conf" to retrieve its settings, or use the file specified
on the command line (-c <file>). Please note, that all paths have to follow cygwin conventions. 

Configuration details are the same as for the Linux version. So please see README for details.
(Note: Open the file in "wordpad" to get the right line breaks.)


PROBLEMS
========

If you figure out problems with this progamm under Windows, please feel free to
file a bug in the Bug Tracking System, hosted at sourceforge. 


Have Fun!
