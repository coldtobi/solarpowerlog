Database scheme for visualization and solarpowerlog capability mapping

the types are the one used by solarpowerlog
originally the visualization uses int(11) for everything.

created timestamp  (PRIMARY KEY)
kdy     float "Energy produced today (kWh)"
kmt     float "Energy produced this month (kWh)"
kyr     float "Energy produced this year (kWh)"
kt0     float "Energy produced accumulated all time (kWh)"
tnf     float "Net frequency (Hz)"
tkk     float "Inverter Temperature (C)"
pac     float "Current Grid Feeding Power"
prl     float "relative Power (%)"
il1     float "AC grid feeding current (A)"
idc     float "DC current in (A)"
ul1     float "AC grid voltage (V)"
udc     float "DC voltage in (V)"
sys     (no easy mapping which will work over different brands)

note: scaling -- as solarmaxwatcher uses int for everything, the data must
be scaled on the php side.
I hope I have patched the php scripts accordingly .. if not, please file bugs
(add patches ;-))
