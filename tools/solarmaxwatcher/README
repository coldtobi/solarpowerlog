NOTICE

This is a php example that works with the DB Writer. Thanks for the solarmax watcher
folks for programming it (it was not programmed for solarpowerlog, but it works with it.)

(Note that the code is quite hacky and would need some refactoring; please provide
patches.... I did not do any checks for security problems, so I do not recommend to
serve that to the Internet without doing so)

For solarpowerlog, I removed the unrelated parts not needed for the PHP
part.

The tar file on which this work based was versioned 0.4.0, (2012-01-10)

Some changes were necessary to adapt it to solarpowerlog, as e.g
there is are different approach to datatypes: solaepowerlog uses real data
scaling, while the solarmaxwatcher used unscaled intergers for everything.
See also db_scheme.txt for the MYSQL Database scheme used.

Configuration:
The database and password needs to be set in (look for mysql_connect for the locations)
- analyzer.php (2 locations!)
- solarertrag.php
- There are a few references to the table names in the code. If you use something other
  than Inverter_$i where i is a number, you need to patch it.
- Many configuratons options are hardcoded in the individual files.

(Sorry for the lack of more documentation)
