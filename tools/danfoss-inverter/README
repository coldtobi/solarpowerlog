This is a simple set of shell scripts which will "simulate" a Danfoss Inverter.
In "double quotes", because it its very simplified:
- Will wait on any incoming bytes 
- Won't do any check on these
- Will answer with a static response.

The purpose of this script is just initial debugging, so don't expect much of
it. It should be replaced by a proper simulator class -- like for the Sputnik.

Syntax:
./netcat_danfoss <port-to-use>

The example solarpowerlog.conf in this directory is crafted to be used with 
./netcat_danfoss 12345
