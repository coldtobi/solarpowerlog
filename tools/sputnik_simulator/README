This is a simple set of shell scripts which will "simulate" a Sputnik Inverter.
In "double quotes", because it its very simplified:
- Will wait on any incoming bytes 
- Won't do any check on these
- Will answer with a static response.

Syntax:
./netcat_sputnik <port-to-use>

The example solarpowerlog.conf in this directory can be used with
./netcat_sputnik 12345
