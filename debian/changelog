solarpowerlog (0.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Worked on the debian integration, package now build fine using
    pbuilder, is linitian warning free and hopefully will find a 
    heartly welcome on debian so ITP can be closed. (Closes: #652904)
  * Implemented feedback from debian-mentors (IRC and mailing list)
  * Updated watch file as upstream will use tar.gz tarballs in the 
    future
